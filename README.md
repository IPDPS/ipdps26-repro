## For IPDPS26 Paper Authors

If your paper is accepted, you will be asked to provide a mandatory Artifact Description (AD) appendix. The Artifact Evaluation (AE) is facultative but strongly encouraged. A LaTeX template for the AD/AE Appendices is provided in [for-paper-authors](for-paper-authors).

Also, see the supporting [guidelines](for-paper-authors).
